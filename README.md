# Availityâ€™s Fullstack Homework Assignment

## Written Responses

#### 1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.

In my first personal project, I worked with a group of my friends to develop an app that helped improve our performance in our favorite video game. Our preferred specialization in the game required a calculator to be effective, and all the calculators that were available at the time were too slow or difficult to use so we decided to build our own. We developed a workflow for how we liked to play the game and from that we derived a list of features and requirements. From there we split assigned roles to each group member including project manager, designer and developer. Because of this tool, we became one of the most well known and notorious groups within our specialization within the game's community.

#### 2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc

#### 3. How would you explain what Availity does to your grandmother?

Availity makes websites that hospitals and doctors can access to talk with insurance companies about patients' coverage, and to collect money from the insurance companies for covered patient care.

## Coding Challenges

#### 4. You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code. Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.

##### Notes

Written in JavaScript. Can be found in the `4-LISP-checker` directory.
I faced few issues while completing this challenge. My original solution did not take nesting into account, and had to be altered to fix this. However, very little was needed to implement this change.
