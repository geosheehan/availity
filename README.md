# Availityâ€™s Fullstack Homework Assignment

## Written Responses

#### 1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.

In my first personal project, I worked with a group of my friends to develop an app that helped improve our performance in our favorite video game. Our preferred specialization in the game required a calculator to be effective, and all the calculators that were available at the time were too slow or difficult to use so we decided to build our own. We developed a workflow for how we liked to play the game and from that we derived a list of features and requirements. From there we split assigned roles to each group member including project manager, designer and developer. Because of this tool, we became one of the most well known and notorious groups within our specialization within the game's community.
